# Attribute-Based-Encryption--Access-control-model
-----
Overview
-----

Implementation of a **Key-Policy Attribute Based Encryption**(based on bilinear maps and secret sharing/reconstruction) model that can be used for access control structures. The document that I
rely on for this implementation is the following: https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/608.pdf.
